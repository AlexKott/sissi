## Introduction
_Sissi_ is a simple static site generator.

## Installation

## Contributing
This is just one of several things that _sissi_ needs for her well being. It is important to keep all settings focussed on her so that she'll always be the center.

Feel free to open an issue or [get in touch](https://alexkott.com), if you're interested in helping _sissi_ through her childhood or see some parenting mistake that you'd like to fix.
